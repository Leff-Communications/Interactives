Thriving Together is a Deloitte project meant to showcase employee benefits in an easily digestible format through the use of hover states, modals, and external links to resources. This includes an html file with an introductory message, along with a grid system showcasing 5 main tiles, each having a hover state, and their respective modal for additional information.

The file system is fairly straitforward, containing all the images needed for design in the 'assets' folder, along with an html, css, and js file that they ingest into their system.

Currently, the project seems to have all the working parts with hover states and modals, but we are still currently testing and finding issues, mainly from their system overwriting specific stylings. Comments have been left within the JS and HTML files to easily navigate to any trouble spots in case those need to be updated at all, but the hope is that most of errors can be resolved through the use of updated stylings, such as needing to create new identifiers to make sure styling isn't overwritten.

Unfortunately, our client is not able to provide us with a testing link to work through the issues, so there will need to be some coordination to test out potential fixes.

Mt CO2eq, at zero cost\n\nGenetic selection and breeding programs focused on reducing CH4 emissions per ruminant could significantly reduce emissions by 2050. Leading experts assert that about 20 percent of a ruminant\u2019s CH4 emissions rate stems from genetics alone. In single herds, intentional breeding for CH4 efficiency has achieved variation in CH4 production of about 20 percent. Today, some available commercial genetics reduce emissions by 5 percent or more per unit. Assuming other factors, for example, productivity, remain steady, applying such commercial genetics in the United States could reduce CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation from about 53kg per cow to about 42kg. \n\nA major challenge to uptake and investment in such genetics today is the lack of economic incentive, given that there are no market payments or credits for CH4. The immaturity and lack of breed-specificity of genetics programs\u2014especially outside of dairy and, more broadly, in low- and middle-income markets\u2014will also inhibit implementation at scale. But new breeding techniques, such as CRISPR or Cas9, could lower barriers to entry for new innovators and allow for more specificity in genetics programs. Targeted investment by majors in the animal genetics space could accelerate

Mt CO2eq, at negative cost (~$5 \/ t CO2eq)\n\nBy expanding and advancing animal health solutions, farmers could improve productivity and reduce animal mortality. In North America today, some such solutions are reducing cattle productivity by a weighted average of about 8 percent per head. In low- and middle-income regions that have less access to animal health products and clinical resources, impact is likely to be significantly higher. The ability to meet the projected protein demand with fewer, healthier cows could reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions from enteric fermentation, manure left on pasture, and manure management proportional to aggregate productivity gains. \n\nThere are, however, significant challenges to achieving this potential. Health challenges vary greatly depending on region and species, meaning there is unlikely to be one, or even a few, silver bullets, from a technology standpoint. Innovation from animal health product manufacturers, expansion of distribution and advisory networks, and public health promotion strategies may unlock implementation at greater

Mt CO2eq, at zero cost\n\nGenetic selection and breeding programs focused on reducing CH4 emissions per ruminant could significantly reduce emissions by 2050. Leading experts assert that about 20 percent of a ruminant\u2019s CH4 emissions rate stems from genetics alone. In single herds, intentional breeding for CH4 efficiency has achieved variation in CH4 production of about 20 percent. Today, some available commercial genetics reduce emissions by 5 percent or more per unit. Assuming other factors, for example, productivity, remain steady, applying such commercial genetics in the United States could reduce CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation from about 53kg per cow to about 42kg. \n\nA major challenge to uptake and investment in such genetics today is the lack of economic incentive, given that there are no market payments or credits for CH4. The immaturity and lack of breed-specificity of genetics programs\u2014especially outside of dairy and, more broadly, in low- and middle-income markets\u2014will also inhibit implementation at scale. But new breeding techniques, such as CRISPR or Cas9, could lower barriers to entry for new innovators and allow for more specificity in genetics programs. Targeted investment by majors in the animal genetics space could accelerate

Mt CO2eq, at negative cost (~$5 \/ t CO2eq)\n\nBy expanding and advancing animal health solutions, farmers could improve productivity and reduce animal mortality. In North America today, some such solutions are reducing cattle productivity by a weighted average of about 8 percent per head. In low- and middle-income regions that have less access to animal health products and clinical resources, impact is likely to be significantly higher. The ability to meet the projected protein demand with fewer, healthier cows could reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions from enteric fermentation, manure left on pasture, and manure management proportional to aggregate productivity gains. \n\nThere are, however, significant challenges to achieving this potential. Health challenges vary greatly depending on region and species, meaning there is unlikely to be one, or even a few, silver bullets, from a technology standpoint. Innovation from animal health product manufacturers, expansion of distribution and advisory networks, and public health promotion strategies may unlock implementation at greater
